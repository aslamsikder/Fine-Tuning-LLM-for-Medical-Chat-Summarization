The most important library here is unsloth, which is specifically designed to make fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) significantly faster and more memory-efficient. This library is the key to making this project feasible on a free, resource-constrained GPU (like a T4 in Google Colab / T4*2 in Kaggle) which typically has VRAM limitations that would prevent standard fine-tuning. We also install trl for its specialized training tools, peft for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and other standard libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem."
