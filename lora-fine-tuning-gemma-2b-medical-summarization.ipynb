Physical examination reveals bilateral papilledema, greater optic nerve erythema in the right eye, a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect, and a right afferent pupillary defect. Muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception are intact. A maculopapular rash is noted on bilateral lower extremities. Lab findings include microcytic anemia (Hemoglobin: 11.6 gm/dL, Hematocrit: 35.3%, MCV: 76.9 fL), hyponatremia (Sodium: 133 mmol/L), elevated ESR (33 mm/hr), and CRP (13.3 mg/L). Urinalysis is normal. Lumbar puncture shows clear fluid, 2 RBCs/µL, and 56 WBCs/µL.\nA: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process affecting multiple systems, including the central nervous system, as indicated by papilledema and abnormal lumbar puncture results. Differential diagnoses could include autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases, or other systemic inflammatory disorders. The presence of optic nerve involvement and systemic symptoms necessitates further investigation to narrow down the causes.\nP: Plan to conduct additional diagnostic tests to explore underlying causes, including imaging studies and specific serological tests. Consultation with a neurologist and possibly a rheumatologist or infectious disease specialist is recommended. Monitor the patient's symptoms closely and provide supportive care as needed.

We also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.\nPatient: Okay. What does that mean?\nDoctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. In the meantime, we'll monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. We'll keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.\nPatient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.\nmodel\nS: The patient, a flooring installer, reports experiencing painless blurry vision in the right eye for the past week. The patient also reports intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for the past 6 months. The patient denies any history of toxic habits, smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use.\nO: Vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in the right eye, greater in the left, with bilateral inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and right afferent pupillary defect. Muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. The maculopapular rash was noted on both bilateral lower extremities. Laboratory findings showed microcytic anemia with hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 33 mm/hr, and CRP at 13.3 mg/L. Urinalysis showed no protein or blood. Lumbar puncture showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.\nA: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory or infectious process, evidenced by the presence of papilledema, optic nerve erythema, visual field defects, and elevated lab values. Differential diagnoses could include an infectious or inflammatory process, such as a viral or bacterial infection, or an autoimmune condition.\nP: The management plan includes monitoring the patient's symptoms and supporting care. Further diagnostic tests such as additional imaging and possible blood tests will be performed to clarify theunderlying cause. The patient will be educated on the importance of reporting any new symptoms or changes in symptoms. Referral to a specialist for further evaluation and management is planned. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and adjust treatment as necessary.\n\n--- END OF FINE-TUNED ---\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install rouge_score\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-10-26T06:49:22.651498Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-10-26T06:49:22.652192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-10-26T06:49:28.278239Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-10-26T06:49:22.652165Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-10-26T06:49:28.277439Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting rouge_score\n  Downloading rouge_score-0.1.2.tar.gz (17 kB)\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\nRequirement already satisfied: absl-py in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rouge_score) (1.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: nltk in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rouge_score) (3.9.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rouge_score) (1.26.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.14.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from rouge_score) (1.17.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: click in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from nltk->rouge_score) (8.3.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: joblib in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from nltk->rouge_score) (1.5.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: regex>=2021.8.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from nltk->rouge_score) (2025.9.18)\nRequirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from nltk->rouge_score) (4.67.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: mkl_fft in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from numpy->rouge_score) (1.3.8)\nRequirement already satisfied: mkl_random in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from numpy->rouge_score) (1.2.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: mkl_umath in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from numpy->rouge_score) (0.1.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: mkl in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from numpy->rouge_score) (2025.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tbb4py in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from numpy->rouge_score) (2022.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: mkl-service in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from numpy->rouge_score) (2.4.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: intel-openmp<2026,>=2024 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from mkl->numpy->rouge_score) (2024.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tbb==2022.* in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from mkl->numpy->rouge_score) (2022.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tcmlib==1.* in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from tbb==2022.*->mkl->numpy->rouge_score) (1.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: intel-cmplr-lib-rt in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from mkl_umath->numpy->rouge_score) (2024.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: intel-cmplr-lib-ur==2024.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from intel-openmp<2026,>=2024->mkl->numpy->rouge_score) (2024.2.0)\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: rouge_score\n  Building wheel for rouge_score (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n  Created wheel for rouge_score: filename=rouge_score-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl size=24934 sha256=d2fb0ead555b8a58d5fe7a2901163e0eb0c5e357e1e0b5eb58d6f65521fee288\n  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/1e/19/43/8a442dc83660ca25e163e1bd1f89919284ab0d0c1475475148\nSuccessfully built rouge_score\nInstalling collected packages: rouge_score\nSuccessfully installed rouge_score-0.1.2\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Cell 12: Quantitative Evaluation on the Test Set**\n\nIn this cell, we evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned Gemma 2B model on the test dataset using standard text summarization metrics: ROUGE and BERTScore.
